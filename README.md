# Digital-IC-Tester
This project involves developing a digital IC (Integrated Circuit) tester designed to verify and identify industrial quantities of plugged ICs. Specifically, the tester is capable of detecting three types of ICs: 74160, 74161, and 74163. Upon detecting the ICs, the tester displays their numbers on a terminal, allowing for efficient and accurate identification
